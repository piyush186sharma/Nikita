        CS-_101 Principles of Computer Programming 3-1-0-4-4:
Fundamentals of Computer:
History of Computer, Generation of Computer, Classification of Computers 2L
Basic Anatomy of Computer System, Primary & Secondary Memory, Processing Unit, Input & Output Devices 3L
Binary & Allied number systems representation of signed and unsigned numbers. BCD, ASII. Binary Arithmetic & logic
gates 6L
Assembly language, high level language, compiler and assembler (basic concepts) 2L
Basic concepts of operating systems like MS DOS, MS WINDOW, UNIX, Algorithm & flow chart 2L
C Fundamentals:
The C character set identifiers and keywords, data type & sizes, variable names, declaration, statements 3L
Operators & Expressions:
Arithmetic operators, relational and logical operators, type, conversion, increment and decrement operators, bit wise
operators, assignment operators and expressions, precedence and order of evaluation. Input and Output: Standard input
and output, formatted output -- printf, formatted input scanf. 5L
Flow of Control:
Statement and blocks, if - else, switch, loops - while, for do while, break and continue, go to and labels 2L
Fundamentals and Program Structures:
Basic of functions, function types, functions returning values, functions not returning values, auto, external, static and
register variables, scope rules, recursion, function prototypes, C preprocessor, command line arguments. 6L
Arrays and Pointers:
One dimensional arrays, pointers and functions, multidimensional arrays. 6L
Structures Union and Files:
Basic of structures, structures and functions, arrays of structures, bit fields, formatted and unformatted files.
CS-_191 Principles of Computer Programming Lab 0-0-3-3-2:
Exercises should include but not limited to:
1. DOS System commands and Editors ( Preliminaries)
2. UNIX system commands and vi ( Preliminaries)
3. Simple Programs: simple and compound interest. To check whether a given number is a palindrome or not, evaluate
summation series, factorial of a number , generate Pascalâ€™s triangle, find roots of a quadratic equation
4. Programs to demonstrate control structure : text processing, use of break and continue, etc.
5. Programs involving functions and recursion
6. Programs involving the use of arrays with subscripts and pointers
7. Programs using structures and files.
